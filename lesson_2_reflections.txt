What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file to keep metadatas of the tracked files in the future. I need to do it because that's the only way to create a repository to track changes to files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different from the working directory since it registers files to be saved. I think it offers great value to developers, by allowing them greater control over what they choose to share.
