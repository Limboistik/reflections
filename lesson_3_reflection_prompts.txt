When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To store and share all the files in the cloud so it's easily accessible with your team or other members.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you can work offline and see what was the last known change, and if there are differences with the remote.
